    "## Learning Arc\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** This module teaches you to implement proactive capacity management for multi-tenant platforms. You'll learn to analyze historical usage patterns and forecast capacity needs using time-series analysis and linear regression, preventing resource exhaustion before it impacts tenants.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concepts Covered:**\n",
    "- Time-series capacity forecasting with linear regression\n",
    "- Historical usage pattern analysis from PostgreSQL\n",
    "- Headroom buffer calculation (20% industry standard)\n",
    "- Multi-threshold alerting (70%, 80%, 90% utilization)\n",
    "- Tenant rebalancing for \"noisy neighbor\" problems\n",
    "- Batch processing for 50+ tenants\n",
    "- Seasonal anomaly handling\n",
    "- Lead time alignment with procurement cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "**After Completing This Notebook:**\n",
    "- You will understand how to analyze 6 months of historical usage data\n",
    "- You can implement linear regression for 3-month capacity forecasting\n",
    "- You will recognize when to apply headroom buffers (20% standard, 30% for volatile workloads)\n",
    "- You can design graduated alert thresholds to prevent alert fatigue\n",
    "- You will identify \"noisy neighbor\" problems and recommend tenant migrations\n",
    "- You can batch-process forecasts for 150+ tenant × metric combinations\n",
    "- You will evaluate trade-offs: explainability vs. accuracy (linear regression vs. LSTM)\n",
    "- You can align forecast windows with hardware procurement lead times\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context in Track L3.M13:**\n",
    "This module builds on M13.1-M13.3 (Performance Optimization Fundamentals) and prepares you for M13.5 (Auto-scaling Implementation) and M13.6 (Cost Optimization)."

    "## Section 10: Decision Card - When to Use This Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear Regression Capacity Forecasting** is ideal for:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Use When:\n",
    "- Historical usage shows **linear or near-linear growth** trend\n",
    "- You need **explainable forecasts** for CFO/budget discussions\n",
    "- Platform is **mature** with stable tenant base (< 10% churn)\n",
    "- Forecast horizon is **short-term** (1-6 months)\n",
    "- Data collection is **monthly-aggregated** (not real-time)\n",
    "- Acceptable accuracy: **±10-15% prediction error**\n",
    "- Team **lacks ML expertise** for advanced models\n",
    "- CFO requires **transparent cost projections**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Do NOT Use When:\n",
    "- Usage patterns are **highly seasonal** (use Prophet or SARIMA)\n",
    "- **Exponential growth** expected (use exponential smoothing)\n",
    "- **Real-time** capacity decisions needed (use streaming analytics)\n",
    "- Platform is **new** with < 3 months data (insufficient history)\n",
    "- Tenant **churn > 25%** (invalidates historical trends)\n",
    "- Budget requires **±5% accuracy** (use ensemble methods)\n",
    "- **Complex interactions** between metrics (use multivariate models)\n",
    "- Compliance requires **worst-case planning** (use percentile-based forecasting)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trade-offs Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Dimension | Linear Regression | Advanced ML (Prophet, LSTM) |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------------|\n",
    "| Accuracy | 85-90% for linear trends | 90-95% with seasonality |\n",
    "| Explainability | High (clear coefficients) | Low (black-box) |\n",

    "## Conclusion: Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "You've completed L3 M13.4: Capacity Planning & Forecasting! Here's what you've learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concepts Mastered:\n",
    "1. **Time-series analysis** using 6 months of monthly-aggregated data\n",
    "2. **Linear regression forecasting** with 3-month prediction horizon\n",
    "3. **Headroom buffer calculation** (20% standard, 30% high-volatility)\n",
    "4. **Multi-threshold alerting** (70%, 80%, 90% utilization)\n",
    "5. **Batch processing** for 150+ tenant × metric forecasts\n",
    "6. **Rebalancing recommendations** to address \"noisy neighbor\" problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Design Decisions:\n",
    "- **Why linear regression?** Explainability beats 5-10% accuracy loss\n",
    "- **Why 6 months?** Captures seasonality without stale data\n",
    "- **Why 20% headroom?** Absorbs Q4 spikes (15-25%) without waste\n",
    "- **Why 3 thresholds?** Graduated responses prevent alert fatigue\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Readiness:\n",
    "✅ Handles insufficient data gracefully (< 3 months minimum)\n",
    "✅ Processes 50+ tenants × 3 metrics < 5 minutes\n",
    "✅ Stores forecasts for dashboard visualization\n",
    "✅ Generates actionable recommendations\n",
    "✅ Integrates with Prometheus, Grafana, Airflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- **M13.5:** Auto-scaling Implementation (trigger scaling from forecasts)\n",
    "- **M13.6:** Cost Optimization (right-sizing recommendations)\n",
    "- **Production:** Connect to real PostgreSQL, set up Grafana dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Resources:\n",
    "- [scikit-learn Linear Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html)\n",
    "- [Google SRE Book - Capacity Planning](https://sre.google/sre-book/software-engineering-in-sre/)\n",
    "- [Facebook Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) (for seasonal forecasting)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Congratulations!** You can now implement production-grade capacity forecasting for multi-tenant platforms. 🎉"
