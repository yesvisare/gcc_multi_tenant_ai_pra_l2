Sample Tenant Capacity Planning Scenarios
==========================================

Scenario 1: E-Commerce Platform - Quarter-End Spike
----------------------------------------------------
Tenant: tenant-ecommerce-001
Current CPU Usage: 72.5%
Historical Pattern: 15-20% spike during quarter-end sales
Forecast: Linear regression predicts 78% base + 20% headroom = 93.6%
Alert Level: CRITICAL - Begin emergency capacity expansion
Action: Add 2 additional compute nodes within 30 days

Scenario 2: FinTech Application - Steady Growth
------------------------------------------------
Tenant: tenant-fintech-042
Current Memory Usage: 62.1%
Historical Pattern: Consistent 2.5% monthly growth
Forecast: 6-month trend predicts 70% + 20% headroom = 84%
Alert Level: WARNING - Initiate procurement process
Action: Plan memory upgrade for next maintenance window

Scenario 3: SaaS Analytics - High Utilization
----------------------------------------------
Tenant: tenant-saas-099
Current Storage Usage: 91.2%
Historical Pattern: Rapid data accumulation (3% per month)
Forecast: Already at 91%, predicted 100%+ within 2 months
Alert Level: CRITICAL - Immediate action required
Action: Archive old data and provision additional storage NOW

Scenario 4: Media Streaming - Storage-Heavy Workload
-----------------------------------------------------
Tenant: tenant-media-123
Current Storage Usage: 93.1%
CPU/Memory Usage: Low (45%, 52%)
Pattern: Unbalanced resource utilization
Recommendation: Storage rebalancing - migrate to storage-optimized nodes
Action: Move tenant to different tier with higher storage capacity

Scenario 5: Healthcare Portal - Balanced Usage
-----------------------------------------------
Tenant: tenant-healthcare-456
Current CPU/Memory/Storage: 63.7% / 70.4% / 58.6%
Historical Pattern: Stable with minor seasonal variations
Forecast: All metrics below 75% threshold for next 3 months
Alert Level: CAUTION - Plan ahead
Action: Monitor and review capacity roadmap quarterly

Rebalancing Example: Noisy Neighbor Problem
--------------------------------------------
Cluster State:
- Node A: tenant-saas-099 (88% CPU) + tenant-fintech-042 (55% CPU) = Overloaded
- Node B: tenant-media-123 (45% CPU) + tenant-healthcare-456 (63% CPU) = Balanced

Imbalance Ratio: (88 - 45) / 88 = 48% (exceeds 30% threshold)

Recommendation: Move tenant-saas-099 from Node A to Node C (underutilized)
Expected Outcome: Node A usage drops to 55%, improving overall balance

Common Failure Patterns
------------------------
1. Insufficient Historical Data: New tenant with < 3 months data
   Fix: Wait for minimum data collection period or use conservative defaults

2. Seasonal Anomaly: Holiday spike not captured in 6-month window
   Fix: Extend history to 12 months or apply seasonal adjustment factor

3. Lead Time Mismatch: Forecast shows 90% in 1 month, procurement takes 3 months
   Fix: Increase forecast window to 6 months for hardware procurement

4. Headroom Inadequate: 20% buffer insufficient for 35% spike
   Fix: Increase headroom factor to 1.35 for high-volatility tenants

5. Alert Fatigue: Too many CAUTION alerts ignored
   Fix: Raise CAUTION threshold to 75% and focus on WARNING/CRITICAL only
