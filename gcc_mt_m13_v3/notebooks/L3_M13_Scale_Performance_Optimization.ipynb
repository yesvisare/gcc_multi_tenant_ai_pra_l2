    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Implement cost attribution and optimization for multi-tenant RAG platforms serving enterprise organizations. This module teaches you how to track per-tenant usage, calculate costs with volume discounts, generate CFO-ready invoices, and detect cost anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concepts Covered:**\n",
    "- Cost Attribution Layers (Direct Costs, Overhead Costs, Allocation Methods)\n",
    "- Multi-Component Cost Formula (LLM + Storage + Compute + Vector Operations)\n",
    "- Volume Discount Tiers (0%, 15%, 30%, 40% based on usage)\n",
    "- Usage Metering with Prometheus/StatsD\n",
    "- Chargeback vs. Showback models\n",
    "- Cost Anomaly Detection (>50% month-over-month spikes)\n",
    "- Platform Economics and ROI calculation\n",
    "- CFO-ready reporting and invoice generation\n",
    "\n",
    "**After Completing This Notebook:**\n",
    "- You will understand the four cost attribution layers and allocation methods\n",
    "- You can implement usage metering tracking queries, storage, compute, and vector operations per tenant\n",
    "- You will build a cost calculation engine applying multi-component formula with overhead allocation\n",
    "- You can generate chargeback reports producing CFO-ready monthly invoices with cost breakdowns\n",
    "- You will detect cost anomalies alerting on >50% cost spikes with root cause analysis\n",
    "- You understand when to use cost attribution vs. simpler alternatives (usage caps, flat fees)\n",
    "- You can validate cost attribution accuracy against actual cloud bills (±10% tolerance)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context in Track L3.M13:**\n",
    "This module builds on M13.1 (caching strategies) and M13.2 (query optimization) by adding financial visibility to your performance optimizations. It prepares you for M13.4 (infrastructure scaling) by quantifying the cost impact of scaling decisions."

    "**Layer 2: Overhead Costs** (shared platform expenses)\n",
    "- Platform team salaries (DevOps, SRE)\n",
    "- Monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, PagerDuty)\n",
    "- Shared infrastructure (load balancers, API gateways)\n",
    "- Typical allocation: 15-25% of direct costs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 3: Allocation Methods**\n",
    "- Usage-based: Overhead proportional to usage (our approach)\n",
    "- Headcount-based: Overhead based on team size\n",
    "- Revenue-based: Overhead based on business unit revenue\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 4: Billing Models**\n",

    "## 11. Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You Learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cost Attribution Layers:** Direct costs, overhead, allocation methods, billing models\n",
    "2. **Multi-Component Formula:** LLM + Storage + Compute + Vector + Overhead - Discounts\n",
    "3. **Volume Discounts:** 0% → 15% → 30% → 40% based on query volume\n",
    "4. **Usage Metering:** Track per-tenant usage with <5ms latency overhead\n",
    "5. **Cost Calculation:** Apply formula with accurate cost constants\n",
    "6. **Chargeback Reports:** Generate CFO-ready invoices with line items\n",
    "7. **Anomaly Detection:** Alert on >50% cost spikes with root cause hints\n",
    "8. **Migration Estimation:** Prevent surprise costs with pre-upload estimates\n",
    "9. **Attribution Validation:** Monthly reconciliation ensures ±10% accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Cost Attribution:**\n",
    "- ✅ 10-50 tenants with stable usage\n",
    "- ✅ CFO enforces chargeback culture\n",
    "- ✅ Platform > 6 months old\n",
    "- ✅ Need ROI proof for budget justification\n",
    "\n",
    "**When NOT to Use:**\n",
    "- ❌ < 10 tenants (manual tracking sufficient)\n",
    "- ❌ Platform < 6 months old (wait for stability)\n",
    "- ❌ Showback culture with no accountability\n",
    "- ❌ Single tenant > 80% of usage (everyone knows who pays)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Platform Economics:**\n",
    "- Cost per query decreases with volume (economies of scale)\n",
    "- Volume discounts incentivize growth and consolidation\n",
    "- Chargeback drives optimization and cost discipline\n",
    "- ROI: ₹10 Cr platform → ₹36 Cr value → 3.6x return\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "1. Implement usage metering in your RAG platform\n",
    "2. Calculate costs with volume discounts\n",
    "3. Generate monthly invoices for CFO\n",
    "4. Set up anomaly detection alerts\n",
    "5. Run monthly reconciliation (validate ±10% accuracy)\n",
    "6. Optimize based on cost insights (cache high-cost queries, archive old data)\n",
