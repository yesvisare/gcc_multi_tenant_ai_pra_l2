# Example Governance Scenarios for L3 M14.4

## Scenario 1: Small GCC with High Compliance
Organizational Context:
- Number of tenants: 8 business units
- Tenant sophistication: Medium (1-2 technical people per BU)
- Compliance level: Critical (SOX, finance/legal requirements)
- Rate of change: Low (stable platform, quarterly releases)

Expected Operating Model: CENTRALIZED
Rationale: Critical compliance requires strong control and audit trails, even at small scale
Team Size: 2 engineers (minimum for redundancy)
Annual Cost: ₹60L (₹7.5L per tenant)

## Scenario 2: Large GCC with Sophisticated Tenants
Organizational Context:
- Number of tenants: 75 business units
- Tenant sophistication: High (dedicated engineering teams)
- Compliance level: Moderate (standard corporate IT policies)
- Rate of change: High (frequent feature requests, experimentation)

Expected Operating Model: FEDERATED
Rationale: Tenants can self-manage, platform provides infrastructure only
Team Size: 4 engineers (infrastructure team)
Annual Cost: ₹1.2Cr (₹1.6L per tenant, tenants self-manage)

## Scenario 3: Medium GCC with Mixed Sophistication (Most Common)
Organizational Context:
- Number of tenants: 45 business units (30 business, 15 engineering)
- Tenant sophistication: Medium (mixed capabilities)
- Compliance level: Moderate (standard corporate compliance)
- Rate of change: Medium (quarterly feature releases)

Expected Operating Model: HYBRID
Rationale: Balance control and velocity, champions bridge technical gap
Team Size: 4 platform engineers + 45 champions (2-4 hours/week each)
Annual Cost: ₹1.2Cr (platform) + ₹45L (champions) = ₹1.65Cr (₹3.7L per tenant)

Escalation Workflow:
- Tier 1 (80%): Self-service portal (quota <10GB, same-org access, FAQ questions)
- Tier 2 (15%): Tenant champions (quota 10-50GB, complex access, configuration changes)
- Tier 3 (5%): Platform team (bugs, features, security incidents, quota >50GB)

## Scenario 4: Real GCC Journey (Scaling 10 → 50 tenants)

Year 1 (10 tenants, centralized):
- Team: 2 engineers
- Requests: 30/month
- Onboarding: 2 days
- Ticket backlog: 3 days
- Satisfaction: 95%
- Cost: ₹60L/year (₹6L per tenant)
- Status: Working well, manual ops acceptable

Year 2 (30 tenants, cracks appear):
- Team: 2 engineers (hiring delayed)
- Requests: 150/month (5× increase)
- Onboarding: 10 days (unacceptable)
- Ticket backlog: 2 weeks (team overwhelmed)
- Satisfaction: 65% (tenants frustrated)
- Cost: ₹60L/year (₹2L per tenant, but service degraded)
- Problem: Team capacity exceeded, math broke (150 requests × 2 hours = 300 hours, only 320 hours available)
- Fix: Emergency hire (added 2 engineers → 4 total), started building self-service portal

Year 2.5 (Self-service portal launch):
- Team: 4 engineers
- Requests: 60/month (60% reduction via self-service)
- Onboarding: 3 days (better, but still manual)
- Ticket backlog: 3 days (manageable)
- Satisfaction: 75% (improving)
- Cost: ₹1.2Cr/year (₹4L per tenant)
- Portal investment: ₹15L (3-month project)
- Better, but still centralized bottleneck for features

Year 3 (50 tenants, hybrid redesign):
- Platform team: 5 engineers (tier 3 only)
- Tenant champions: 50 champions (1 per BU)
- Requests: 500/month total, but distributed:
  * Tier 1 (80%): 400 auto-resolved by portal
  * Tier 2 (15%): 75 handled by champions
  * Tier 3 (5%): 25 escalated to platform team
- Platform team workload: 25 requests/month (was 60)
- Onboarding: 1 day (mostly self-service + champion)
- Ticket backlog: 2 days (excellent)
- Satisfaction: 92% (tenants love self-service)
- Cost: ₹1.5Cr (platform) + ₹50L (champions) = ₹2Cr/year (₹4L per tenant)
- Champion training: 2-day program × 50 people = 100 person-days investment
- Success: Scaled to 50 tenants without linearly scaling team

Key Learnings:
1. Centralized works until ~15 tenants, then needs self-service
2. Self-service buys time until ~30 tenants, then needs champions
3. Hybrid works from 30-100 tenants with proper training
4. Governance framework must evolve with scale (annual review)
5. CFO/CTO/Compliance alignment took 3 months (critical, don't skip)

## Scenario 5: Common Failures

Failure 1: Centralized Bottleneck
- GCC: Financial services, 25 tenants
- Problem: 3 engineers, 75 requests/month × 3-4 hours each = 225-300 hours (exceeds capacity)
- Symptom: Ticket backlog 3 weeks, tenants complaining to CFO
- Root cause: No self-service, every request needs hand-holding
- Fix: Built self-service portal (₹15L, 3 months), reduced request time 80% (3 hours → 30 min)
- Result: 75 × 30 min = 38 hours/month (manageable), backlog cleared in 1 month

Failure 2: Federated Chaos
- GCC: Tech company, 60 tenants, federated model
- Problem: 60 different embedding models, 12 tenants with PUBLIC S3 buckets (data leak risk)
- Symptom: Security audit found vulnerabilities, cost overruns (₹50L/year waste)
- Root cause: No platform-enforced standards, tenants made mistakes
- Fix: Moved to hybrid with guardrails (OPA policies, 3 approved configurations)
- Result: 12 security issues → 0, cost savings ₹50L/year

Failure 3: Hybrid Without Champions
- GCC: Manufacturing, 40 tenants, attempted hybrid
- Problem: Champions were VPs/Directors with no time (15 min/week vs. 2-4 hours needed)
- Symptom: Tier 2 requests unanswered, everything escalated to platform team anyway
- Root cause: Champion role not properly staffed (wrong people, no time allocation)
- Fix: Re-scoped champions to senior engineers with 10% time + training + recognition (₹50K bonus)
- Result: 85% of tier 2 requests resolved by champions, platform team focused on tier 3

## Scenario 6: Self-Service Adoption Plateau

GCC: 50 tenants, built excellent self-service portal
Expected: 80% adoption
Reality: Plateau at 65-70%

Why the 20-30% refuses self-service:
- Type 1: "Just Fix It for Me" tenants (10%) - Business users with learned helplessness
  Fix: Make self-service EASIER than ticket submission, add inline help
- Type 2: Edge Case tenants (10%) - Genuinely complex requirements that don't fit workflows
  Fix: Accept this, 10% tier 3 escalation is fine
- Type 3: Compliance Paranoid tenants (5%) - Want paper trail for every change
  Fix: Educate on audit trails (self-service portal logs everything too)
- Type 4: Champion Bypass tenants (5%) - Escalate directly to platform, bypass champion
  Fix: Enforce escalation policy, route bypasses back to champion

Economic Reality:
- 60% self-service: 200 requests × 40% = 80 human-handled = 40 hours/month
- 80% self-service: 200 requests × 20% = 40 human-handled = 20 hours/month (2× better)
- 90% self-service: 200 requests × 10% = 20 human-handled = 10 hours/month (marginal gain)

Diminishing returns: Stop at 80-85% self-service, don't fight for 100%

## Scenario 7: Cost Comparison (Centralized vs. Decentralized)

50 tenants, medium complexity, hybrid model:
- Centralized platform team: 5 engineers = ₹1.5Cr/year
- Champions: 50 × ₹1L/year = ₹50L/year
- Total: ₹2Cr/year (₹4L per tenant)

Alternative: Decentralized (1 engineer per tenant):
- 50 tenants × 1 engineer × ₹30L = ₹15Cr/year
- Total: ₹15Cr/year (₹30L per tenant)

Savings: ₹15Cr - ₹2Cr = ₹13Cr/year (87% reduction)
ROI: ₹15Cr / ₹2Cr = 7.5× (platform provides 7.5× ROI)

This is why centralized platforms exist: Economies of scale through shared infrastructure and self-service.

## Scenario 8: SLA Tiers

Platinum Tier (10 tenants):
- Availability: 99.99% (52 minutes downtime/year)
- Response time: 200ms P95
- Support response: 15 minutes
- Incident priority: P0
- Dedicated support: Yes (1 engineer assigned)
- Cost: ₹12L per tenant per year (3× silver)

Gold Tier (25 tenants):
- Availability: 99.9% (8.7 hours downtime/year)
- Response time: 500ms P95
- Support response: 1 hour
- Incident priority: P1
- Dedicated support: No (shared pool)
- Cost: ₹6L per tenant per year (1.5× silver)

Silver Tier (15 tenants):
- Availability: 99% (3.65 days downtime/year)
- Response time: 1000ms P95
- Support response: 4 hours
- Incident priority: P2
- Dedicated support: No (best-effort)
- Cost: ₹4L per tenant per year (baseline)

Total: 50 tenants, weighted average ₹7L per tenant
Revenue: ₹3.5Cr/year from tenants (via chargeback)
Platform cost: ₹2Cr/year
Profit: ₹1.5Cr/year (platform runs at 43% margin)

## Scenario 9: Platform Maturity Assessment

Assessment for 3 dimensions:

Onboarding (Level 3 - Defined):
- Evidence: Process documented, partially automated, time tracked
- Gaps: No error tracking, no optimization based on data
- Next actions: Measure onboarding errors (target <5%), implement rollback, A/B test UX

Self-Service (Level 2 - Repeatable):
- Evidence: Portal exists, documented
- Gaps: Only 60% adoption (target 80%), no success rate measurement
- Next actions: Add auto-approval for tier 1, track adoption metrics, optimize workflows

Monitoring (Level 3 - Defined):
- Evidence: Per-tenant metrics, SLA tracking, alerting
- Gaps: No predictive monitoring, no auto-remediation
- Next actions: Implement anomaly detection, auto-remediate common issues

Overall Maturity: Level 2.7 (between Repeatable and Defined)
Priority Focus: Self-Service (lowest maturity) - Increase adoption to 80%
