    "**Purpose:** Application-layer validation alone is insufficient for multi-tenant security. This module teaches you to architect document storage so tenant isolation is enforced at the storage layer, not just the application layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concepts Covered:**\n",
    "- Bucket-Per-Tenant isolation model (maximum security, ₹20L/year for 50 tenants)\n",
    "- Shared Bucket + IAM Policies isolation (complex but scalable, ₹8L/year)\n",
    "- Hybrid Model with TenantS3Client wrapper (RECOMMENDED - balances security and cost)\n",
    "- Presigned URLs with tenant validation (5-minute expiration, tag verification)\n",
    "- Data residency enforcement for multi-region compliance (GDPR, DPDPA, HIPAA)\n",
    "- TenantS3Client wrapper implementation (prevents direct boto3 access)\n",
    "- Comprehensive audit logging for storage access (CloudTrail patterns)\n",
    "- Cost trade-offs between isolation models (bucket limits, IAM complexity)\n",
    "- Security vulnerabilities from application-only validation (leaked credentials, direct Console access)\n",
    "- Multi-region bucket strategy (EU, US, India separate buckets)\n",
    "- KMS encryption with tenant-specific keys (₹75/key/month)\n",
    "- Cross-tenant attack prevention (prefix validation, object tagging)\n",
    "\n",
    "**After Completing This Notebook:**\n",
    "- You will understand why application-layer validation is insufficient (bugs, credential leaks, Console access)\n",
    "- You can implement three distinct S3 isolation models with production-ready code\n",
    "- You will design tenant-aware presigned URLs that enforce boundaries\n",
    "- You can build data residency enforcement for multi-region compliance\n",
    "- You will create comprehensive audit logging for storage operations\n",
    "- You can analyze cost trade-offs between bucket-per-tenant vs shared-bucket approaches\n",
    "- You will prevent cross-tenant document access through wrapper-based enforcement\n",
    "- You can implement TenantS3Client that automatically scopes all operations to tenant prefix\n",
    "- You will generate presigned URLs with security checks (prefix validation, tag verification)\n",
    "- You can enforce data residency requirements at upload time (block wrong-region uploads)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why Application-Layer Validation is Insufficient:**\n",
    "Even with tenant ID checks in code, vulnerabilities exist through:\n",
    "- Bugs in validation functions (logic errors, edge cases)\n",
    "- Accidental removal of checks during code review\n",
    "- Direct S3 access via AWS Console (bypasses application)\n",

    "Healthcare GCC with 25 hospital tenants. Developer accidentally removes tenant validation check during refactoring. One hospital can now access another's patient records through the API. Even worse: if AWS credentials leak, attacker can download ALL documents directly from S3 Console."

    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Maximum isolation (bucket-level security boundary)\n",
    "- Simplest IAM policies (one policy per bucket)\n",
    "- Clear cost attribution (per-bucket billing)\n",
    "- Distinct audit trails (per-bucket CloudTrail)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- AWS bucket limits (100 default, 1,000 with request)\n",
    "- Management overhead for 50+ tenants\n",
    "- Per-bucket provisioning complexity\n",
    "- Per-bucket logging costs\n",

    "**Recommendation:** Premium GCCs with <100 tenants\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Model 2: Shared Bucket + IAM Policies\n",
    "**Structure:** One bucket with tenant-specific IAM roles; isolation via bucket policies and object tagging\n",

    "**IAM Policy Pattern:**\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"Effect\": \"Deny\",\n",

    "- Harder cost attribution\n",
    "- One misconfigured policy enables data breach\n",

    "\n",
    "### Failure 1: Weak Prefix Validation\n",
    "**Risk:** Users manipulate keys to access other tenants  \n",
    "**Fix:** Validate prefix immutably in wrapper, never allow bypass\n",
    "\n",
    "### Failure 2: Missing Object Tagging\n",
    "**Risk:** Objects uploaded without tenant_id tags become unattributable  \n",
    "**Fix:** Mandatory tagging on every upload, tag validation before presigned URL generation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Failure 3: Presigned URL Over-Sharing\n",
    "**Risk:** URLs shared externally, cached in browsers, forwarded to others  \n",
    "**Fix:** Short expiration (5 minutes), audit every generation, track URL usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Failure 4: Cross-Tenant IAM Misconfiguration\n",
    "**Risk:** Over-permissive bucket policies allow cross-tenant reads  \n",
    "**Fix:** Use explicit deny policies, regular IAM audit, principle of least privilege\n",
    "\n",
    "### Failure 5: Data Residency Bypass\n",
    "**Risk:** Engineers upload to wrong region to meet deadline  \n",
    "**Fix:** Client-level region enforcement, CloudTrail alerts, monthly compliance audits\n",
    "\n",
    "### Failure 6: Unencrypted Metadata\n",
    "**Risk:** Object metadata (tenant_id tags) visible in CloudTrail  \n",
    "**Fix:** Use private tags not searchable, encrypt metadata in application\n",
    "\n",
    "### Failure 7: Presigned URLs Valid for Hours\n",
    "**Risk:** Long-lived URLs forwarded externally and accessed after intended expiration  \n",
    "**Fix:** Change ExpiresIn=300 (5 minutes) in generate_presigned_url() call\n",
    "\n",
    "### Failure 8: Database Query Timeout (N+1 Queries)\n",
    "**Risk:** Fetching tenant metadata for each document during bulk upload  \n",
    "**Fix:** Cache tenant metadata in Redis with 1-hour TTL"

    "- 15 EU logistics companies (GDPR: must stay in eu-west-1)\n",
    "- 10 India financial services (RBI: must stay in ap-south-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Decisions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Hybrid Model** (shared bucket + tenant prefixes + wrapper)\n",
    "   - Scales to 1000+ tenants without bucket limits\n",
    "   - Cost ₹8L/year vs ₹20L for bucket-per-tenant\n",
    "   - Still achieves high isolation through wrapper enforcement\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multi-Region Bucket Strategy**\n",
    "   - Create 3 separate S3 buckets in 3 regions\n",
    "   - TenantS3Client routes based on tenant.data_residency_region\n",
    "   - Each region has independent lifecycle, encryption, logging\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Encryption Strategy**\n",
    "   - Create 50 individual KMS keys (one per tenant)\n",
    "   - Cost: 50 × ₹75 = ₹3,750/month\n",
    "   - Enables key rotation per tenant independently\n",
    "   - Audit trail per key\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cost Attribution**\n",
    "   - Tag all objects with tenant_id and team (for chargeback)\n",
    "   - Use AWS Cost Explorer to drill down by tag\n",
    "   - Report monthly storage costs per tenant\n",
    "   - Implement S3 lifecycle: Standard → Intelligent-Tiering → Glacier after 90 days\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Compliance Reporting**\n",
    "   - CloudTrail logs all access (immutable audit)\n",
    "   - Monthly audit reports: who accessed what, when\n",
    "   - Automated anomaly detection: >100 API calls/hour per tenant flags alert\n",
    "   - GDPR Data Subject Access Requests: query CloudTrail + object list for citizen data\n",

   "source": [
    "## 9. Decision Card: When to Use This Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use This Solution When:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **50+ tenants** with varied data residency requirements (GDPR, DPDPA, HIPAA)  \n",
    "✅ **Documents >100MB** requiring efficient download (presigned URLs avoid proxy overhead)  \n",
    "✅ **Multi-region compliance mandatory** (EU, US, India with separate buckets)  \n",
    "✅ **Cost optimization critical** (shared infrastructure reduces costs by 60%)  \n",
    "✅ **Audit trail required** for regulatory compliance (CloudTrail + database logging)  \n",
    "✅ **Team has AWS expertise** (IAM, KMS, S3 bucket policies)  \n",
    "✅ **Asynchronous document access** (uploads/downloads don't block application flow)  \n",
    "✅ **Large document corpus** (>10GB total storage across all tenants)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### DO NOT Use When:\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **<10GB total storage** across all tenants (database BYTEA simpler)  \n",
    "❌ **Simple row-level database security sufficient** (no regulatory compliance needs)  \n",
    "❌ **Team lacks AWS expertise** and can't hire (IAM misconfiguration risks)  \n",
    "❌ **Budget for managed solutions** like Dropbox Business (₹10-50/GB/month)  \n",
    "❌ **Synchronous document access required** (<100ms latency needed)  \n",
    "❌ **Write-heavy patterns** (>10K uploads/day incur high S3 PUT request costs)  \n",
    "❌ **Single-region deployment** (multi-region overhead unnecessary)  \n",
    "❌ **Documents <100MB** accessed frequently (database storage more efficient)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Trade-offs:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost:**\n",
    "- Bucket-Per-Tenant: ₹20L/year for 50 tenants (higher isolation, higher cost)\n",
    "- Shared Bucket (Hybrid): ₹8L/year for 50 tenants (60% savings)\n",
    "- Cross-region transfer: ₹6/GB for data movement\n",
    "- KMS encryption: ₹75/key/month + ₹0.24/10K API calls\n",
    "\n",
    "**Latency:**\n",
    "- Presigned URL generation: <200ms (with Redis cache)\n",
    "- Direct S3 download: 50-500ms (depends on region proximity)\n",
    "- Cross-region access: +100-300ms (if user far from bucket region)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity:**\n",
    "- Bucket-Per-Tenant: Low (simple IAM, easy to understand)\n",
    "- Shared Bucket + IAM: High (complex policies, tag discipline required)\n",
    "- Hybrid (TenantS3Client wrapper): Medium (wrapper must be used consistently)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security:**\n",
    "- Best: Bucket-Per-Tenant (physical isolation)\n",
    "- Good: Hybrid with wrapper enforcement (application-level isolation)\n",
    "- Risk: Shared Bucket + IAM (policy misconfiguration vulnerability)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Zero cross-tenant document access attempts in audit logs\n",
    "- All documents properly tagged with tenant_id within 48 hours\n",
    "- Presigned URL generation <200ms (Redis cache hit rate >80%)\n",
    "- Data residency violations = 0 (enforcement active)\n",
    "- Cost per GB/month = ₹1.75 standard + ₹0.05 for tagging overhead"

    "## 10. Hands-On: Practathon Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Implement Hybrid Model with verified isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✓ Set up S3 bucket with tenant prefixes (simulated in offline mode)\n",
    "2. ✓ Implement TenantS3Client wrapper (already done in module)\n",
    "3. ✓ Generate and validate presigned URLs (tested above)\n",
    "4. ✓ Set up audit logging (demonstrated with StorageAuditLogger)\n",
    "5. ✓ Implement data residency enforcement (validated with DataResidencyValidator)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria:**\n",
    "- ✓ Tenant A cannot download Tenant B's documents (verified with Forbidden exception)\n",
    "- ✓ Presigned URLs expire after 5 minutes (default expiration=300)\n",
    "- ✓ Cross-region upload attempts blocked (DataResidencyViolation raised)\n",
    "- ✓ All access logged with timestamps and user IDs (audit_logger.log_access())\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "1. Review the source code in `src/l3_m12_document_storage/__init__.py`\n",
    "2. Run the test suite: `pytest tests/test_m12_document_storage.py -v`\n",
    "3. Start the FastAPI server: `./scripts/run_api.ps1`\n",
    "4. Explore API endpoints at http://localhost:8000/docs\n",
    "5. Configure AWS credentials in `.env` to test with real S3"

    "## Conclusion & Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Learnings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Application-layer isolation is insufficient** - storage-layer enforcement is essential\n",
    "   - Bugs, leaked credentials, and direct Console access bypass application checks\n",
    "   - TenantS3Client wrapper enforces prefix isolation at the client level\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hybrid Model (shared bucket + wrapper + prefixes)** balances security, scale, cost for most GCCs\n",
    "   - Scales to 1000+ tenants without AWS bucket limits\n",
    "   - 60% cost savings vs bucket-per-tenant (₹8L vs ₹20L annually)\n",
    "   - Wrapper prevents direct boto3 access, enforces tenant scoping\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multi-region storage is mandatory** for regulated industries\n",
    "   - GDPR (EU), DPDPA (India), HIPAA (US) require regional data residency\n",
    "   - Plan for ₹60K+/month cross-region transfer costs\n",
    "   - DataResidencyValidator blocks wrong-region uploads before S3 API call\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Presigned URLs must be validated BEFORE generation**, not trusted after\n",
    "   - Always check: prefix matches tenant, document exists, tags match tenant_id\n",
    "   - 5-minute expiration prevents URL forwarding abuse\n",
    "   - Audit log every URL generation for compliance trail\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data residency is legal requirement**, not optional compliance checkbox\n",
    "   - GDPR violation fines: up to ₹20M+ (4% revenue)\n",
    "   - Enforce at upload time with region validation\n",
    "   - CloudTrail alerts for cross-region access attempts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture Patterns Applied:**\n",
    "- Wrapper pattern (TenantS3Client wraps boto3)\n",
    "- Prefix-based isolation (tenant-{id}/ enforced immutably)\n",
    "- Defense in depth (prefix + tagging + IAM + wrapper)\n",
    "- Audit logging for all operations (CloudTrail + database)\n",
    "- Multi-region data residency enforcement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Modules:**\n",
    "- **L3 M12.3:** Implement query isolation (vector DB + traditional DB separation)\n",
    "- **L3 M12.4:** Compliance automation (GDPR/HIPAA audit trails)\n",
    "- **L3 M13:** Scaling to 500+ tenants (performance optimization)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production Checklist:**\n",
    "- [ ] Configure AWS credentials in .env (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)\n",
    "- [ ] Set up Redis for presigned URL caching (reduces S3 API calls)\n",
    "- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL for audit logging (immutable compliance trail)\n",
    "- [ ] Create KMS keys per tenant (encryption key rotation)\n",
    "- [ ] Set up CloudTrail in all regions (us-east-1, eu-west-1, ap-south-1)\n",
    "- [ ] Implement cost attribution tags (tenant_id on all objects)\n",
    "- [ ] Configure S3 lifecycle policies (Standard → Glacier after 90 days)\n",
    "- [ ] Enable cross-region replication for DR (RTO <1 hour)\n",
    "- [ ] Set up anomaly detection alerts (>100 API calls/hour)\n",
    "- [ ] Test GDPR Data Subject Access Request workflow\n",
